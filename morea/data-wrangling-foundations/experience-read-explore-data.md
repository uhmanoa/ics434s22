# Reading and exploring data in Pandas

Pandas is a central tool for data analysis in Python. This course will heavily rely on it. As such, it is natural that we start by looking at what Pandas can do. Complete this experience after reading Chapter 2 of the pydata book.

## Task

Create a Jupyter Notebook that contains the code necessary to reproduce Figure 2-3 (Percentage Windows and non-Windows users). Include only the code required to reproduce the figure.

Interleave your code with markdown cells that include formatted text to describe what each cell does.

## Submission instructions

By the time and date indicated on the Schedule page, you must have:
  * Reproduced Figure 2-3 in a notebook called `experience-read-explore-data.ipynb`.
  * Submitted your notebook to a folder called `module_2`.
  * Submit the [form](https://www.cognitoforms.com/MoseliMotsoehli/ReadingAndExploringDataInPandas) confirming that you completed the experience.

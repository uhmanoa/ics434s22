Making plots and visualizations is one of the most critical parts of data analysis. It may be a part of the exploratory process. Visualization can, for example, help identify outliers, transform data, or come up with model ideas. This section focuses on fundamental matplotlib plots for visualizing basic data types. The outcomes for this module are:

 * Understanding Matplotlib's basic syntax
 * Understanding fundamental Matplotlib data types including Figure, Axes
 * Understanding layout and grids
 * Getting familiar with distributions, lines, proportions, and point scatter plots
 * Getting familiar random sampling methods in the `random` and `np.random` modules

Visualization will be a recurring theme, and we will expand on the topics covered in this module over the semester.

# Install Python and Other Tools

ICS 434 will use the Python programming language and the Jupyter Notebooks and DataSpell as principal IDE. To install Python and data science libraries, we will be using [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/index.html) 
Conda is an open-source package management system and environment management system that runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux. Conda quickly installs, runs, and updates packages and their dependencies. 
Also, note that the course will use Github to copy and submit assignments. Since most, if not all, have already taken a software engineering course, I will assume that you've already installed Github. If not, I suggest you install Github Desktop and follow Dr. Johnson's tutorials below:

* [Introduction to GitHub's Desktop Application - part 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwC1wU0f5KM&t=50s)
* [Introduction to GitHub's Desktop Application - part 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXjtKhMp5bo&t=3s)
